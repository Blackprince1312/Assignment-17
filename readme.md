### Learning Objectives

After completing this assignment, you should:

* Demonstrate an understanding of Constructors & instances of them
* Demonstrate Prototypal Inheritance
* Marry DOM events with creating instances of Objects

## Normal Mode
        
> First and foremost, please have fun with this. This encapsulates all of the things you have worked with so far and possibly some new things you'll learn as you push yourself. Remember to break this down into small tasks and commit often.

1. Create a Game

  * Must contain Constructors & Prototypes
  * Must have some type of logic built into it, even it that is just that there is a random winner each time.
  * Must have a nice design around it
  * Must be deployed to Surge and completely working


_If_ you are looking for more direction, you can follow this template.

  * Different Types of Players
  * Different Types of Enemies
  * Each player/enemy instance will start with an amount of points (health, life, etc)
    * When a bad guy attacks a good guy, the good guy's points go down
    * When a good guy attacks a bad guy, the bad guy's points go down
  * When the player/enemy hits 0, show something visually that they have been defeated and who the winner is
  * Use underscore `_.random()` or a different method to make sure there is a different outcome each time the game is played

## Hard Mode

- Use [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/2.3/introduction.html) or [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/)/[Chai](http://chaijs.com/) to write unit tests for each constructor and method in your game.

## Nightmare Mode

- Along with Hard mode, add Konami code to your game for a quick way to win!

## Deliverables

1. Deploy to Surge
2. Comment and Close the GitHub issue assigned to you and comment with a link to both your repository and your deployed project.
